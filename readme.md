# Movie Seek

_Sample project by Karlis Paegle_

Overall project could be improved by fetching data in the background, since OMDb API only returns 10 item pages, but that introduces problem of showing response to user in real time. Maybe could push web socket event on success on BE.

## Steps for running this project

1. Copy .env.example to .env and set value of OMDB_API_KEY
